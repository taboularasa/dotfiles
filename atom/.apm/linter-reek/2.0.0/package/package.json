It will be used with\nfiles that use the Ruby syntax.\n\n## Installation\nLinter must be installed in order to use this plugin. It is a hard dependency.\nIf Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions\n[here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).\n\n### Installing Reek\nBefore using this plugin, you must ensure that `reek` is installed on your\nsystem. To install `reek`, do the following:\n\n1. Install [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).\n\n2. Install [Reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek) by typing the following in\na terminal:\n   ```\n   gem install reek\n   ```\n\nNow you can proceed to install the linter-reek plugin.\n\n### Installing the Plugin\n```\n$ apm install linter-reek\n```\n\n## Settings\nYou can configure linter-reek from its settings panel or by editing\n~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu). The only thing that\nneeds to be configured is the path to the `reek` executable.\n\n### Executable Path\n```\n'linter-reek':\n  'reekExecutablePath': /path/to/your/reek/here\n```\nRun `which reek` to find the path (if you're using rbenv run `rbenv which reek`).\n\n**Note**: This plugin finds the nearest config.reek file and will automatically use it if it exists. If it does not, `reek` will run with its default settings.\n\n## Contributing\nIf you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:\n\n1. Fork the plugin repository.\n1.
